Unlike 64-bit Windows, 32-bit uses decorated function names, so the default dumpbin export
described there doesn't work.

Instead, the technique is to modify the stock nNOTES.def and build the lib from that. The
needed format is __stdcall from https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/56h2zst2.aspx

The second @number value CAN be retrieved from the dumpbin export, though, so it's still useful -
it's the first column. The quick way to get the parameter length for an undocumented function is
to attempt to link it as-is and get the decorated name from the error message.

Note: for some reason, even though the official .def file includes underscores in front of function
names, these have to be _removed_ when generating with the lib command. Maybe the toolchain changed
over time.

Once that's tweaked, then the lib can be generated in a command prompt with the VC vars set (such
as from the bat file in the bin dir):

lib /def:nnotes.def /out:notes.lib /machine:x86
